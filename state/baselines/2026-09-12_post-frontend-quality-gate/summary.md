# arcanium baseline — 2026-09-12_post-frontend-quality-gate

**Purpose:** 00_frontend_design_toolchain.md + 00_frontend_quality_gate.md executed: Playwright/Impeccable/Taste installed and validated, DESIGN.md/PRODUCT.md/QUALITY.md created, two real UI defects fixed (topbar overlap, unresponsive lifecycle grid), one real accessibility fix (login contrast), one real BLOCKER found+fixed (logout 400 via missing Keycloak post-logout-redirect-uri), one systemic accessibility gap documented (arc-text-dim app-wide) and one fitness-test flakiness bug fixed
**Captured:** 2026-09-12T18:45:47Z
**Source commit:** 6875f54
**Previous baseline:** 2026-09-12_pre-frontend-design-toolchain

## Project context

ARCANIUM_AUTH_ENABLED = true

Arcanium is a Vault Enterprise cryptographic control-plane demo:
`arcanium/{api,ui,cli}` + Vault (3-node Raft + transit-seal + HSM) +
OpenLDAP/Keycloak identity (Prompt 18) + supplier-tenant workloads.
